### Approach 1

```python
def doubleL(n):
    res = []
    for i in range(n):
        res.append(i * 2)
    return res

for i in doubleL(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

- **Description:** This approach defines a function `doubleL(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input. It initializes an empty list `res`, iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1`, multiplying each number by 2, and appends the result to the `res` list. Finally, it returns the `res` list. The `for` loop outside the function calls `doubleL(5)` and prints each element of the returned list separated by a colon.

### Approach 2

```python
for x in [n * 2 for n in range(5)]:
    print(x, end=' : ')
```

- **Description:** This approach uses a list comprehension `[n * 2 for n in range(5)]` to create a list where each element is obtained by multiplying each number in the range from 0 to 4 by 2. Then, it iterates through each element of this list and prints it followed by a colon.

### Approach 3

```python
def doubleG(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield i * 2

for i in doubleG(5):
    print(i, end=' : ')
```

- **Description:** This approach defines a generator function `doubleG(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input. It iterates through the range from 0 to `n-1`, multiplying each number by 2, and yields the result. The `for` loop outside the function calls `doubleG(5)` and iterates through the values yielded by the generator, printing each value followed by a colon.

---

Regarding the type of function `doubleG(n)`:

- `doubleG(n)` is a generator function because it contains a `yield` statement and produces a sequence of values one at a time when iterated over.
- The advantage of using a generator function like `doubleG(n)` is that it doesn't construct the entire list of doubled values in memory at once, unlike the list comprehension approach. Instead, it yields values one by one as needed, which can be more memory-efficient especially for large ranges or when dealing with memory-constrained environments. This approach can also improve performance as it doesn't require storing all values in memory before processing them.
